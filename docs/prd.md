### **1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for **Project Linq** (working title), a modern, frictionless digital business card application. The primary vision is to create the fastest and most elegant way for professionals, creators, and entrepreneurs to create and share their contact information and online presence.

The market research (see *Digital Business Card Application Technical Spike*) confirms a strong user demand for no-login, free-to-use solutions with sophisticated features like Apple Wallet integration. Our V1 product will target this demand by providing a high-quality, web-first experience that is simple to use, visually appealing, and respects user privacy. We will differentiate by focusing on superior user experience, performance, and a curated set of modern design templates.

### **2. Goals & Objectives**

#### **Product Goals**
*   **PG1:** Launch a fully functional V1 that allows users to create, customize, and share a digital business card without requiring an account.
*   **PG2:** Achieve a "card creation to share" time of under 90 seconds for a new user.
*   **PG3:** Ensure seamless and reliable Apple Wallet integration.
*   **PG4:** Deliver a mobile-first, responsive experience that performs excellently on all modern devices.

#### **Business Goals**
*   **BG1:** Achieve significant user adoption, measured by the number of cards created in the first quarter post-launch.
*   **BG2:** Establish a foundation for future premium features (V2) by building a positive brand reputation with a high-quality free offering.
*   **BG3:** Validate the "no-login" model as a viable user acquisition strategy.

### **3. Target Audience**

*   **Primary:** Tech-savvy professionals, freelancers, small business owners, and creators who need a quick, modern way to share their contact information and portfolio/social links at networking events, conferences, or in digital communications.
*   **Secondary:** Enterprise sales and marketing teams looking for a scalable solution (future consideration).

### **4. Core User Flows**

1.  **The Creator Journey (Anonymous User):**
    *   User lands on the homepage.
    *   User immediately sees input fields for creating their card and a live preview pane.
    *   User fills in their details (name, role, socials, etc.).
    *   User selects a design template from a list. The live preview updates instantly.
    *   User finalizes the card and clicks "Create My Card."
    *   The system generates a unique, permanent, and non-guessable URL for their card (e.g., `app.com/card/a7bS2-xY9pQ`).
    *   The user is taken to a "Share & Save" page displaying their completed card's QR code, the unique URL, and an "Add to Apple Wallet" button. This page will also serve as their private analytics dashboard link.
2.  **The Recipient Journey:**
    *   Recipient scans the Creator's QR code or clicks their unique URL.
    *   They are taken to the Creator's public-facing digital card page.
    *   They can interact with the links (e.g., call phone number, send email, visit website).
    *   They see a "Save Contact" button which downloads a `.vcf` file (vCard).

### **5. Functional Requirements (Features)**

#### **F-1: Anonymous Card Creation & Data Fields**
A web form on the landing page will allow users to create a card without an account.

*   **Details:**
    *   The form will feature a real-time, side-by-side preview of the card.
    *   **Input Fields (V1):**
        *   **Required:** Name
        *   **Optional:**
            *   Profile Photo or Logo (image upload)
            *   Job Title / Role
            *   Company Name
            *   Short Bio/Tagline (max 250 characters)
            *   Phone Number
            *   Email Address
            *   Website URL
            *   Social & Professional Links: LinkedIn, GitHub, X (Twitter), Instagram.
            *   **Suggested Additional Fields:**
                *   **Location:** City/Country or a physical address.
                *   **Booking/Calendar Link:** For Calendly, SavvyCal, etc.
                *   **Custom Links:** A flexible key-value section allowing users to add up to 3 custom links (e.g., "My Portfolio", "Latest Project").

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   User can create a card by filling out only their name.
    *   The live preview updates in real-time as the user types or uploads an image.
    *   Input validation is present for fields like email and URLs.

#### **F-2: Template System & Live Preview**
Users must be able to choose from a curated selection of designs.

*   **Details:**
    *   Provide **5-10 modern, professionally designed templates**.
    *   Templates will control layout, typography, and color schemes.
    *   The live preview pane must accurately reflect the final card appearance.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can click a template thumbnail, and the live preview instantly updates.
    *   The selected template choice is saved upon card creation.
    *   Templates are fully responsive and render correctly in the preview pane for both mobile and desktop views.

#### **F-3: Card Output & Sharing**
Once created, the card must be easily shareable and saveable.

*   **Details:**
    *   **QR Code:** Generate a high-quality QR code (SVG preferred) that links to the card's unique URL.
    *   **vCard Download:** A "Save Contact" button on the public card page will generate and download a `.vcf` file compliant with the **vCard 4.0 standard**.
    *   **Unique URL:** The non-guessable URL is the canonical link to the card and the key for analytics tracking.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The QR code is scannable by standard iOS and Android camera apps.
    *   The downloaded `.vcf` file correctly populates contact fields on both iOS and Android.

#### **F-4: Apple Wallet Integration**
A key feature for iOS users to quickly access their own card for sharing.

*   **Details:**
    *   On the "Share & Save" page, an "Add to Apple Wallet" button will be prominent.
    *   Clicking this button will generate and prompt the user to add a `.pkpass` file to their Apple Wallet.
    *   The Wallet pass will display the user's name, role, and the QR code for sharing.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The pass can be successfully added to an iPhone's Wallet.
    *   The QR code on the pass is clear and scannable.
    *   The implementation will use a third-party service (e.g., PassKit API) for V1 to mitigate complexity and speed up development, as recommended by the technical spike.

#### **F-5: Privacy-First Analytics Dashboard**
Provide valuable insights to the card's creator without compromising their or their viewers' privacy.

*   **Details:**
    *   The "Share & Save" page (accessible only via the secret URL given to the creator) will double as the analytics dashboard.
    *   **Metrics to Track (Anonymously):**
        1.  **Total Card Views:** A simple counter incremented on each page load of the unique card URL.
        2.  **Link Clicks:** Track clicks on each individual link (Website, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.). Display as a simple count (e.g., "GitHub: 30 clicks").
        3.  **Unique Visitors (Optional for V1):** A "soft" metric using privacy-friendly methods (e.g., local storage flags or IP hashing) to estimate unique viewers over a time period (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   **Heatmaps:** For V1, we will defer complex pixel-tracking heatmaps. The "link-by-link" click count serves as a "link heatmap" and satisfies the core executive request while being simpler and more privacy-conscious.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Analytics are tied to the secret card URL, requiring no login.
    *   All tracking is anonymous and does not use personally identifiable information (PII) or invasive cookies.
    *   The dashboard updates in near real-time.

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** The public card page must achieve a Google Lighthouse performance score of 90+. Initial load time should be under 2 seconds on a standard 4G connection.
*   **Compatibility:** The application must function correctly on the latest two versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It must be fully responsive on all standard device viewports from 360px to 1920px width.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, ensuring it is usable for people with disabilities (e.g., proper color contrast, screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).
*   **Privacy & Security:** No user data will be sold or shared. All analytics will be aggregated and anonymous. A clear privacy policy will be accessible from the footer.

### **7. Recommended Technical Architecture**

Based on the technical spike, the following architecture is recommended for V1:

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React (with Next.js or similar)** to build a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This provides a single codebase, fast performance via Static Site Generation (SSG) for the landing page, and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the dynamic card pages.
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   **QR Code:** `EasyQRCodeJS` or `qrcode.react` for its customization options.
    *   **vCard:** A library that supports the vCard 4.0 specification.
    *   **UI/Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling.
*   **Third-Party Services:**
    *   **Apple Wallet:** **PassKit API** (or a similar service) to handle `.pkpass` generation and signing.
*   **Hosting & Deployment:** **Vercel** or **Netlify**. These platforms are ideal for React/Next.js applications, offering seamless CI/CD, scalability, and cost-effective hosting for a static/serverless architecture.
*   **Analytics Backend:** A lightweight serverless function (e.g., Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda) connected to a simple, scalable database (e.g., Vercel KV, Redis, DynamoDB) to store anonymous view and click counts.

### **8. Assumptions & Constraints**

*   **No User Accounts (V1):** The entire V1 product will operate without user registration, login, or passwords. This implies that if a user loses their unique card URL, they will not be able to edit their card or view its analytics. This is an accepted trade-off for simplicity in V1.
*   **Feature Scope:** V1 is limited to the features described above. Advanced features like card editing, team management, and multiple card creation are out of scope for this iteration.
*   **Cost:** The product will be 100% free for users in V1.

### **9. Future Scope (V2 Considerations)**

*   **User Accounts:** Introduce optional email/social login to enable card editing, management of multiple cards, and a persistent analytics dashboard.
*   **Premium Tier:** Introduce paid features such as advanced analytics (e.g., time-series data, geographic heatmaps), premium templates, company branding, and team management features.
*   **Native Mobile Apps:** Evaluate building native iOS/Android apps using Flutter or React Native if PWA limitations become a significant factor.
*   **Contact Management:** A built-in lightweight CRM to manage contacts collected via the card.

### **10. Success Metrics**

The success of V1 will be measured against the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

*   **User Adoption:**
    *   Number of cards created per week/month.
    *   Bounce rate on the landing page.
*   **Engagement:**
    *   Percentage of created cards that are added to Apple Wallet.
    *   Average number of clicks per link on an active card.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Average page load time.
    *   Lighthouse scores.
