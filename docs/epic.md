Of course. As a technical lead, breaking down the product vision into actionable development tasks is a critical step. Here is a detailed breakdown of the project into Jira Epics and Tickets, based on the PRD and technical research.

---

### **Jira Project: Digital Business Card (LINQ)**

---

### **Epic 1: Project Foundation & CI/CD Setup**

**Goal:** Establish a robust, scalable, and automated foundation for the project. This epic covers setting up the development environment, component library, and deployment pipeline to enable rapid and reliable iteration.

---

#### **Tickets:**

**Ticket: LINQ-1 - Initial Project Scaffolding & Tooling**
*   **Title:** Setup Next.js PWA with TypeScript & Base Tooling
*   **Background:** To ensure code quality, consistency, and a modern development experience, we need to initialize the project with industry-standard tools. This ticket creates the "hello world" version of our application.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A new Git repository is created.
    *   The project is initialized using `create-next-app` with TypeScript.
    *   ESLint, Prettier, and husky (for pre-commit hooks) are configured and working.
    *   The application runs locally (`npm run dev`) and displays a basic placeholder page.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Framework: Next.js 14+ (with App Router)
    *   Tooling: `eslint-config-next`, `prettier`, `husky`

**Ticket: LINQ-2 - Automated Deployment Pipeline**
*   **Title:** Configure CI/CD with Vercel/Netlify for Automatic Deployments
*   **Background:** A core principle of our development process is continuous delivery. This ticket ensures that every merge to the `main` branch is automatically deployed to production, and every PR has a preview deployment.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The GitHub repository is connected to a Vercel or Netlify project.
    *   A push to the `main` branch successfully triggers a deployment to the production URL.
    *   Opening a pull request automatically generates a unique preview URL.
    *   Environment variable handling is set up in the hosting provider's dashboard.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Platform: Vercel (preferred for Next.js) or Netlify.

**Ticket: LINQ-3 - Core UI Layout & Component System**
*   **Title:** Implement Base App Layout and Install UI Component Library
*   **Background:** To build UIs quickly and consistently, we need a foundational layout (header, footer, main content) and a component system. This avoids re-inventing basic UI elements like buttons and inputs.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A root layout component is created, defining the overall page structure.
    *   A simple header and footer are present on all pages.
    *   Tailwind CSS is integrated and configured.
    *   A component library (e.g., `shadcn/ui`, `MUI`) is installed, and a basic `Button` component from the library is used on the homepage.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS.
    *   Components: `shadcn/ui` is recommended for its copy-paste, non-library approach that aligns well with custom design needs.

### **Epic 2: Core Card Creation & Customization**

**Goal:** Enable a user to seamlessly input their information, upload a photo, and customize the look of their card with a real-time preview, all without an account.

---

#### **Tickets:**

**Ticket: LINQ-4 - Card Input Form UI**
*   **Title:** Build the Static UI for the Card Creation Form
*   **Background:** This ticket focuses on creating the visual structure of the form where users will input their data. It's the primary interactive element on the landing page. Logic and state will be handled in a subsequent ticket.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A React component for the form is created.
    *   All input fields specified in PRD section F-1 are present (Name, Role, Bio, Socials, etc.).
    *   The form is styled using the installed UI/component system and is fully responsive.
    *   Basic client-side validation attributes (e.g., `type="email"`) are included.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use components from the chosen UI library (`shadcn/ui` Input, Textarea, etc.) for all form elements.

**Ticket: LINQ-5 - Real-Time State Management & Live Preview**
*   **Title:** Connect Form Inputs to State and Render in Live Preview Component
*   **Background:** To provide instant feedback, we need to link the form's input values to a state management system and reflect those changes in a live preview component.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A state management solution (e.g., React Context, Zustand) holds the card's data.
    *   Typing in any form field updates the state in real-time.
    *   A separate `LivePreviewCard` component consumes this state and re-renders on any change.
    *   The preview accurately reflects the data entered in the form.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   State Management: Start with React's built-in `useState` or `useReducer` for simplicity.
    *   Structure: Keep the form logic and preview display in separate, modular components.

**Ticket: LINQ-6 - Template Selection UI & Logic**
*   **Title:** Implement Template Selector and Apply Styles to Live Preview
*   **Background:** A key feature is customization. This ticket allows users to select from a predefined list of templates, which will dynamically alter the appearance of their card in the live preview.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A UI displays thumbnails for 5-10 templates.
    *   Clicking a template thumbnail updates the application state with the selected template's identifier.
    *   The `LivePreviewCard` component dynamically changes its styling (layout, fonts, colors) based on the selected template state.
    *   The default template is applied on initial page load.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use CSS variables or conditional class rendering (e.g., `clsx` with Tailwind) to switch between template styles efficiently.

**Ticket: LINQ-7 - Profile Photo/Logo Upload**
*   **Title:** Implement Image Uploader with Client-Side Preview
*   **Background:** A visual identity is crucial for a business card. This ticket enables users to upload a photo or logo and see it instantly on their card preview.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A file input allows users to select a `jpg`, `png`, or `svg` file.
    *   The selected image is displayed in the `LivePreviewCard` component immediately.
    *   The image data (as a Base64 string or object URL) is stored in the application state.
    *   A basic file size limit (e.g., 5MB) is enforced on the client side.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use `FileReader` API to read the image file for client-side preview.
    *   Consider a library like `react-dropzone` for a better drag-and-drop UX.

### **Epic 3: Card Generation, Sharing, & Wallet Integration**

**Goal:** To finalize the card creation process by generating a permanent, shareable artifact (URL, QR Code, vCard) and enabling seamless integration with Apple Wallet.

---

#### **Tickets:**

**Ticket: LINQ-8 - Backend: Persist Card Data**
*   **Title:** Create Serverless Function to Save Card Data and Generate Unique URL
*   **Background:** When a user clicks "Create My Card," we need to save their card's configuration to a database and generate a unique, non-guessable ID for their card's URL.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A Next.js API route or serverless function is created.
    *   The function accepts the card data (JSON) from the client.
    *   It generates a unique ID (e.g., nanoid) and saves the data to a database keyed by this ID.
    *   It returns the unique ID to the client upon success.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Database: Vercel KV or Redis for simplicity and speed.
    *   ID Generation: `nanoid` library.

**Ticket: LINQ-9 - Public Card & Share Page**
*   **Title:** Build Dynamic Public Card Page and Post-Creation Share UI
*   **Background:** This ticket covers two fronts: the public page that recipients see, and the private page the creator sees after creation, which contains sharing tools.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A dynamic route (`/card/[id]`) fetches data from the database based on the ID and renders the public-facing card.
    *   After creation, the user is redirected to a "Share & Save" page.
    *   This page displays the permanent URL, a QR code, a "Save Contact" button, and an "Add to Apple Wallet" button.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) with revalidation for the public card page for optimal performance.
    *   QR Code Library: `EasyQRCodeJS` or `qrcode.react`.
    *   vCard Library: A JS library that can generate a vCard 4.0 compliant `.vcf` file blob.

**Ticket: LINQ-10 - Apple Wallet Pass Generation**
*   **Title:** Integrate Third-Party Service to Generate and Serve .pkpass File
*   **Background:** A key differentiator is Apple Wallet support. This ticket implements the backend logic to generate a Wallet pass using an external API to manage the complexity of signing.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A new serverless function is created to handle Wallet pass requests.
    *   The function securely calls a third-party service (e.g., PassKit API) with the necessary card data.
    *   The function returns a valid `.pkpass` file.
    *   Clicking the "Add to Apple Wallet" button on the share page successfully triggers the pass download and prompts the user to add it.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Service: **PassKit API** as recommended in the spike.
    *   Security: Store API keys securely as environment variables in Vercel/Netlify.

### **Epic 4: Privacy-First Analytics**

**Goal:** Provide card creators with valuable, anonymous engagement metrics without compromising user privacy.

---

#### **Tickets:**

**Ticket: LINQ-11 - Backend: Analytics Tracking Endpoint**
*   **Title:** Create Serverless Function to Track Card Views and Link Clicks
*   **Background:** To power the analytics dashboard, we need a lightweight backend endpoint to receive and record anonymous interaction events.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A serverless function (e.g., `/api/track`) is created.
    *   It accepts a `cardId` and an `eventType` (e.g., 'view', 'link_click') and a `linkName` if applicable.
    *   It increments a counter for the corresponding event in the database (e.g., a Redis HASH).
    *   The endpoint is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency responses.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use a simple key-value store like Vercel KV or Redis for fast atomic increments.

**Ticket: LINQ-12 - Frontend: Implement Tracking Beacons**
*   **Title:** Fire Tracking Events from the Public Card Page
*   **Background:** This ticket connects the public-facing card to our analytics backend, sending a signal whenever a card is viewed or a link is clicked.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A 'view' event is sent to the tracking endpoint when the public card page loads.
    *   A 'link_click' event (with the link's name, e.g., 'github') is sent whenever an outbound link is clicked.
    *   The `navigator.sendBeacon()` API is used to ensure the request completes even if the user navigates away.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` for its reliability in sending analytics data without delaying page navigation.

**Ticket: LINQ-13 - Analytics Dashboard UI**
*   **Title:** Fetch and Display Analytics Data on the Private Share Page
*   **Background:** The final piece is to present the collected data to the card creator on their private share page.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The private share page fetches the analytics data for its `cardId` from a new backend endpoint.
    *   It displays the "Total Card Views" count.
    *   It displays a list of all tracked links and their respective click counts (e.g., "Website: 15", "LinkedIn: 42").
    *   The UI is clean, simple, and easy to understand.
*   **Technical Suggestions:**
    *   Create a new API route to fetch aggregated analytics data for a given card.
    *   Use a simple data visualization library or custom components to display the stats.
